GrepRipper
==========
What is GrepRipper ?
--------------------
GrepRipper is a free Windows grep utility that aims to provide fast regular expression search with
a friendly UI similar to the popular (but out-of-date) BareGrep utility. It's formerly known as FunkyGrep.

It is written in C# and requires the .NET 8.0 to build and run.

It is preferable to compile from a git working copy to get changeset ids embedded into the version number.
